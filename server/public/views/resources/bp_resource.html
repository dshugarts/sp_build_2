    <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
        The approach to treat and prevent hypertension is multi-factorial in nature and may
        include changes to your diet, stress, and physical activity. This is not to say that all
        must be modified at the same time; changes in any of these categories,
        independently, haven shown to be beneficial in reversing the rise in high blood
        pressure in symptomatic individuals.
        Diet
</br>
</br>
    <h4><strong>Nutrition</strong></h4>
        The recommend approach for those with hypertension is to follow the Dietary
        Approach for Stopping Hypertension (DASH) guidelines, which is supported by
        trusted organization such as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLB)
        and the Mayo clinic. The hallmark of this action plan is to focus on consumption of
        vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy foods; along with moderate amounts of whole
        grains, fish, poultry and nuts. Due to the close relationship between Sodium intake
        and blood pressure a modified DASH does exist that emphasizes reduction of this
        mineral from your food.
    </br>
</br>
    <h4><strong>Stress Management</strong></h4>
        Stress, evolutionary speaking, is a natural response to one’s environment whenever
        an individual perceives an environment as threatening. Over the years of evolution
        we have stopped to concern ourselves with lions and tigers, and have replaced the
        stress responses towards more constant threats: job responsibilities, financial
        obligation, timely commutes, etc. The over reliance on the stress response is harmful
        in many ways and has a direct impact on your cardiovascular system. The stress
        response causes a phenomenon to your arteries known as vasoconstriction, in
        which the arteries of your body narrow in diameter in other to facilitate blood flow
        to muscles and tissues. Each individual stress response elevates blood pressure,
        with more stressful events leading to higher levels of Systolic and Diastolic
        pressures. In other words, stress has a significant and powerful impact on blood
        pressure.
    </br>
</br>
        In order to control your stress many strategies are available in which are easy and
        simple to use. They can range from engaging in mind-body activities such as Yoga
        and meditation, to simply spending time with loved ones and friends. The idea is for
        you to create an environment in which you mind can be occupied by tasks that are
        enjoyable to you and take your mind always from threats; not a fan of Yoga or a pint
        with the friends? Get a hobby!
    </br>
</br>
    <h4><strong>Physcial Activity</strong></h4>
        The minimum recommendation for physical activity of 150 minutes a week of
        moderate aerobic activity per week was not set arbitrarily. This, according to
        numerous research papers, is the amount of time necessary for the body to respond
        to the effects of exercise in a positive way. The benefits are too many to list here, but
        direct to blood pressure they include: improved heart function, reduction in resting
        heart rate, increase vascularization of muscle, and enhanced ability to manage stress
        (and its hormones) – all in all an very effective way to reduce blood pressure
